# replazy
This extension aims to add a humble set of buttons and keep them always available without extensive checking.
Therefore you do not have to use a shortcut or look for the links for those actions. 
They are always available but effective when an email is open,
Reply and Forward works when an email is open. 
Reply to all works when an email is open and there is more than one email in the chain (what a surprise!)

It injects 3 buttons, and use some material icons from Google and some custom style to make it looking better!

You can do whatever you want with the code.
